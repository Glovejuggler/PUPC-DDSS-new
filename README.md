# Polytechnic University of the Philippines Calauan Campus - Digitalized Document Storage System
This project is a revamp of an old one of the same name due to lack of other required functionalities and also improve the user interface.
The original aim of the project was for a locally-hosted system like Google Drive where they can upload files and folders, while also having some different capabilities depending on the role. It also allows the users (the members of the faculty) to track the changes on their folders and files by having an activity log which they heavily emphasized as a requirement. This revamp also added a module for the campus registrar for the tracking of the entrance credentials of the students and all other documents.

## Features
- File upload, folder creation, file and folder sharing and other basic filesystem capabilities
- Role-based visibility of files and folders (which can be shared to other roles or other specific users if needed)
- Registrar module to add students and upload their entrance credentials and other requirements
